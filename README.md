# BerkeleyCS61B
My self-study of Berkeley's CS61B course - 2018 spring version (so I can use the publicly available autograder).

Skeleton code for assignments taken from https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp19 

The folder structure of the skeleton code has been preserved so that I can take advantage of the public Gradescope access - see https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/115229260 for a good guide on this

## Finished assignments
HW/Projects:
